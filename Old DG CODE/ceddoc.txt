      GENERAL NOTES


1. Freshly deleted or copied text
can  be  inserted  at  a

using the AF or BE commands.
2. While in Modify mode you  can
use the  F5 key to split a line.
Move the cursor to the point  in
a line  where a split should
occur.  Press the F5 key.
3. The  DE (delete)  command is a
special case.   DE entered alone
deletes 1 line. nnDE, where nn is
a number  from 1 to 99, deletes 1
to  99  lines  beginning  at  the
current line.
4.  To replicate lines:
        a. Use CB (copy block) to
           copy lines of text.
        b. Use AF (after)  or BE
           (before) to insert the
           new text.
    To move lines:
        a. Use  DB (delete block)
           or DE to remove lines.
        b. Use  AF (after) or BE
            (before) to re-insert

WARNING...WARNING...WARNING

The delete  and copy commands use
the same save area;  therefore,
use  AF  (after)  and BE (before)
with  that   text  until  another
delete/copy  command.    To save
lines of text, use the CF  (copy
to file)  command.   Use FA (file
after) and  FB  (file  before) to
insert the saved text as needed.
